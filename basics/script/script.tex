\section{The Application Script}

In any Mojolicious application, there will always one application script.
Its existance is the only necessary requirement in a Mojolicious application.
This script is used to start and stop the app.
It can be used to perform querys about your app, like which routes are available, request a given resource/page or even evalutate code against a running app!

The script can come in one of two forms, depending on whether your application is a full or lite app.
A full application needs a only small script which is simply used to bootstrap the main application class.
In contrast, the script for a lite app might be the entire application, including route definitions, actions, and templates.

In concept the two types of applications are not all that different.
It is not tremendously incorrect to imagine that a lite application is simply the \lstperl!startup! method of a full application, with a simple domain specific language (dsl) for sugar.
For now, this text will focus on lite apps to get started, just remember that there is nothing magical about lite apps (see Section \ref{sec:lite_not_magical}).
