%XXX consider making an architecture section

When designing a Mojolicious application, authors usually follow the accepted Model-View-Controller architecture.

The model layer is intentionally unspecified.
Perl, and its massive CPAN (see \url{http://metacpan.org} for more) have many options for database interaction.

Mojolicious is agnostic to the Model layer, though some suggestions for useful modules are \cpan{DBIx::Connector} for connection management or \cpan{DBIx::Class} as an ORM.

Also worthy of a mention is the Mojolicious spin-off project \cpan{Mango}, a non-blocking interface to MongoDB.

Mojolicious applications typically are a well structured set of files, defining Perl classes, templates, tests and other supporting files.
These classes represent your application and its controllers, in addition to any model logic that you might include.

While using this full structure is highly encouraged for production, for fast prototyping, and especially for presenting examples, this structure becomes cumbersome.
